# 🛰️ KuiperLock

**KuiperLock** is an experimental open-source project focused on space cybersecurity.

The goal is to create tools that help identify and prevent vulnerabilities in satellite firmware, communication protocols, and mission software — especially for CubeSats, small satellite teams and future lunar digital infrastructure systems.

> This project is in its very early phase. Nothing is functional yet. Contributions, ideas, and feedback are welcome.

## 🔍 What It Might Eventually Do

- Scan satellite and lunar infrastructure codebases for security issues
- Fuzz communication protocols (like CCSDS)
- Provide a checklist for securing telemetry and firmware
- Explore vulnerabilities in open-source space systems
